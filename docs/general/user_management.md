## Introduction

In Conviso Platform, the admin user can send an invitation to new users and manage who should have access to their information.

You can manage three types of access:

- **Company**: User has full company access to all features;

- **Projects**: the user will only have control of the projects he has been granted access to;

- **Vulnerabilities**: The user will only have control of the vulnerabilities he has been granted access to.

## Inviting New Users

Log in to the [Conviso Platform](https://app.convisoappsec.com);

On the top bar menu to the right, click on **Invite Users** button:

On the users access screen, click on the blue **+** button to the right, to create a new user invitation:

The **Add a new** user modal will be shown. On the **E-mails** field, type the new user e-mail address (or choose an existing one, if you are changing an existing user access profile) and choose a Team wich the user will be assigned to on the drop-down list **Teams**. Next, choose what kind of access will be granted to the user, by choosing one of the three radio buttons: **Company**, **Projects** or **Vulnerabilities** (details on the next section in this document).
