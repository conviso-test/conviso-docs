In Appsec-Flow, the admin user can send an invitation to new users and manage who should have access to their information.

On the platform you can manage three types of access:

Company: User has full company access to all features.

Analyzes: the user will only have control of the analysis in which he was invited.

Vulnerabilities: The user will only have access to the vulnerability to which access has been granted.

A point of attention when granting access is to check what permission the user should have.

At the top right click on "Invite users", follow the example below.

After clicking on the "Invite users" button, we will be redirected to the New accesses screen, in this step we add the email and team that the user will have access to in Appsec Flow.

Access types:

Company: User has full company access to all features.

Analyzes: the user will only have control of the analysis in which he was invited.

Vulnerabilities: The user will only have access to the vulnerability to which access has been granted.

After choosing the type of access and adding the email, click the "+" button, follow the example.

Performing this process, an email will be sent to the user who must accept the invitation.
