**Lesson 7 Contents**:

Many web applications and APIs do not adequately protect sensitive data such as financial, health or personally identifiable data (PII). Attackers can steal or modify this poorly protected data to carry out credit card fraud, identity theft or other crimes. Sensitive data needs extra security protections like encryption when stored or in transit, such as special precautions when switched with the web browser.
