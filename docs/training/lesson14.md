**Lesson 14 Contents**:

Insufficient logging and monitoring, together with a non-existent or insufficient incident response, allows attackers to persistently abuse the system, use it as input to attack other systems, and alter, extract or destroy data. Some of the studies demonstrate that the time required to detect a data breach is over 200 days and is typically detected by external entities rather than internal processes or monitoring.
