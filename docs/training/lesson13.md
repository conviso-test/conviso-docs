**Lesson 13 Contents**:

Components such as libraries, frameworks and other software modules run with the same privileges as the application. Abusing a vulnerable component can lead to serious loss of data or complete control of a server. Applications and APIs that use components with known vulnerabilities can weaken the application's defenses, allowing for various attacks and impacts.
